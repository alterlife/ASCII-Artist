# ASCII-Artist

A pure html/javascript ASCII Art Generator. 

Converts a source image to ASCII art using HTML for color output or plain text for black-and-white output. This project uses HTML canvas and the file API to perform the conversion on client side. The image is never uploaded to the server.
